Functions in Javascript
- basically the same thing as functions in python
- when declared, performs a set of statements to either do a job or calculate a value
	# kinda important though; a function is better off when it only performs one atomic task.
- takes parameters
- There are various functions, like those that actually just performs a set of tasks or those that return values.
