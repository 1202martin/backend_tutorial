Modules

    To prevent redundancy in declaration variables which are applied natively to global scope, MODULARITY is required.
    - kinda like using local variables in Java

    *Modules: Small building blocks that contain functions and variables that are only effective within the boundaries
              of the module.
        - Core Concept of Node.js
        - e/ .js files are considered Modules, and the functions and variables that belong in that file are thought to be
          private functions and variables.
        - every Node.js application has at least 1 module (.js file) called "Main Module"
