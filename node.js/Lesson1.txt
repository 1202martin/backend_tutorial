*NodeJS : Open source, X-Platform runtime-envrionment for javascript outside browsers
	-Often used to script Backend-services like Application Programming Interfaces

1. Architecture
	-Essentially, Node is composed of the V8 Engine && a few additional C++ S/W to run JS outside of a browser; this allows for access to resources
	 like the File System, Ports, Network resources, and etc.
	* Node != Programming Language
	  Node != Framework (like django)
2. How Node Works
	-Asynchronous(Non-Blocking) nature; resources that take requests from different components of the S/W work "asynchronously" from the actual
	 servers, increasing the efficiency in how H/W resources are handled.
	-Recommended for Data-Intensive applications that make a lot of use for I/O or Network resources; not much so for those that have high CPU
	 usage.
